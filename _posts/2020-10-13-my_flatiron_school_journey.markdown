When I decided to learn at Flatiron school there was much knew and more I didn't know. My previous experience was as a Graphic Designer and I was tasked to create a web design of a potential web application. After entering the Bootcamp, I needed to learn how to structure my time. The time I gave at the beginning was the time recommended, but when learning a new curriculum you've only had a brief time with, there should be an effort on your part to touch upon your learning skills. Learning my study habits and reworking them was difficult and took patience. In the beginning, I had to relisten to lectures and pay close attention to the labs. When it came time to my first project I was behind and worried. The confidence I gained came from the amount of material Flatiron provides. There is so much that can be found about how to implement one thing or the syntax of another.

After passing my first assessment, I was less confident because of the hurdle I took to get passed it. What challenged me was that I learned from then that I need to find more time to study and practice coding. Learning out to take notes and recite them when asked is important. Practicing all the code I've learned plus more. The concepts of what worked and what has changed tripped me up on my next assessment, so I repeated the section. The Rails framework was so dense and I thought about ways to study it without forgetting Sinatra and Ruby too much, but in the end, I needed to not worry about forgetting because it repeated itself in some instances. 

Active Record is where learning about your server-side application uses all of your prior knowledge in theory. Much of my experience was with CRUD being the backbone of Rails. Looking into the routes and learning the flow of it all to the controllers. After I passed my Rails application I thought that JavaScript before looking into it was a front in like building forms, but then I had to learn to how to use fetch() and about Object-Oriented JavaScript. These concepts were hard and again I needed to make a plan to transition. It is responsible to look into the technologies you will be using before you start the curriculum, I learned this the hard way and tried to get a feel of things on the go. 

By the time I made it to the last module I had figured out a way to learn React and Redux, and still practice my previous lessons because I knew they'd come in hand. I was getting familiar with projects that used React and examples on Redux, Components, and import/exporting modules. This all came in handy when building out my applications, and I made two for practice, and whatever I knew the most was implemented into my final. They were not entirely different from one another but I would have fun with different domains. Working on all of this was possible with a ton of support, great cohort leads, and educational coaches.
